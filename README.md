## Vehicular Accidents Leading to Death of Children


### Story Pitch & Summary
Every year, hundreds of children die due to vehicular accidents. A lot of these accidents are preventable, as some causes of deaths include drivers being on their phone or under the influence while they’re behind the wheel. Each life lost is one less graduation, wedding, accomplishment, that a family won’t get to celebrate with their loved child. 

In 2019, there was 1239 deaths of children between <5-15 years old. The data for this project provided 10 age groups with an eleventh being for individuals of an unknown age. In California alone, there was 104 deaths of children between <5-15 years old, making up a total of 8.4% of the nation's deaths for these ages due to vehicular accidents. 




### Anaysis


#### Q1: What % of all vehicular accidents were children

First,  I unmerged cells and took only relevant date, which was age groups that I wanted (3) of them.

Summed the 3 total groups (=sum B2:B4)

Divided by total number of deaths w/ age groups 

=(B16/B14)

Used % function to turn .0341 to 3.41%

Answer: 3.41% children (1239 deaths)
