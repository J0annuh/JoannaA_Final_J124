### Story Pitch
Every year, hundreds of children die due to vehicular accidents. A lot of these accidents are preventable, as some causes of deaths include drivers being on their phone or under the influence while they’re behind the wheel. Each life lost is one less graduation, wedding, accomplishment, that a family won’t get to celebrate with their loved child.
